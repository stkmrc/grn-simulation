# Gene regulatory network structure informs the distribution of perturbation effects

This is the repository for "[Gene regulatory network structure informs the distribution of perturbation effects](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.04.602130)" (Aguirre MA, Spence JP, Sella G, and Pritchard JK; *bioRxiv* 2024).

Source code is located in the `src` directory, and scripts to reproduce the main analyses and figures are in the `figures` directory. For detailed methodology and correspondence, please consult the publication.

## Installation and Setup

To prepare your environment and run the code, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):**

   Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   If a `requirements.txt` file is available, install required packages with:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If no such file exists, please refer to the publication or source code comments for dependency details.

4. **Verify Python version:**

   Ensure you are running Python 3.8 or newer:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

5. **Additional notes:**

   - Some analyses may require additional system libraries or data files; see the publication or supplementary materials for details.
   - If you encounter issues during setup or execution, please open an issue in this repository.

Following these steps will help ensure a reproducible environment for running the code and reproducing the results.
